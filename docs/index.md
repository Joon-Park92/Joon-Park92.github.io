Hi, I'm Sean, Machine Learning Engineer. 

I have been interested in jobs related to mathematics. That's why I studied economics, electronics and math in university. I found that machine learning is closely related to my interest and started my career as AI engineer. 

I love to apply the technologies to solve real-world problems. So I joined startup company where I have to face complex situation to solve. I believe that the experience to solve problems is the driving force for growth.
